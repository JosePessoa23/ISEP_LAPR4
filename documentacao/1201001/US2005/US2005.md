### 1.1. User Story Description

As Warehouse Employee, I want to open a web dashboard presenting the current status of the AGVs as well as their position in the warehouse layout and keeps updated automatically (e.g.: at each minute).

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

From the client clarifications:

* Question: "Our question is, between what applications should the SPOMS protocol be implemented? Should the HTTP server be part of the "BackOfficeApp" and communicate with the AGV Manager using the REQUESTS_API? Or should the HTTP server be its own application and communicate only with the "BackOfficeApp", which on the other hand communicates directly with the database?"
    * [Answer: ](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=16700) "However, a question stands out: where the data to be presented by the "HTTP server" comes from? The "backoffice Application" (or one of its components) must, somehow, get the data from the "AGV Manager" (and/or the system database). In addition, you should notice that the SPOMS2002 protocol relies on the TCP and not on HTTP. There is nothing wrong here."
    


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* It must be used the provided application protocol (SPOMS2022).
* The dashboard is intended to be displayed on a web page provided by an existing HTTP server in the "BackOfficeApp" application and only available to localhost.
* The dashboard web page is kept updated without reloading.
