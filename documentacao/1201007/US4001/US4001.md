## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As Project Manager, I want that the "AGVManager" component supports properly, at request, the needs of the "BackOfficeApp" application as well as the needs the AGV digital twin.
### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

From the client clarifications:

* Question: "What type of communication do you want, i.e., what are the communications that you want to have between these two. Like AGV Manager says "Take a product" and AGV Digital Twin says "Taken"? Is it something like that? Or am i confused?"
    * [Answer: ](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=16593#p21297) "The communication must follow the SPOMS2022 protocol. It is up to you and your team to devise a set of messages fulfilling the business requirements properly."

* Question: "Regarding the USs 1901,4001, 5001, and 5002, what would you consider its complete state, that is, what would be the criterion to define whether or not this US is functional?"
    * [Answer: ](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=16437#p21107) "For all of those US, the communication between the two involved components must be implemented in accordance with the SPOMS2022. The requests processing can be somehow mocked. For instance, if processing a request implies saving some data to the database, the component can instead write such data to a log (mocking). Latter, on next sprint, the teams implement the interaction to the database."



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* It must be used the provided application protocol (SPOMS2022).
* It is suggested the adoptiong of concurrent mechanisms (e.g. threads) and state sharing between these mechanisms.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* A client must be executed for the server to have any functionallity
