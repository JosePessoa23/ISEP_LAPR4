# US 2001 - As Warehouse Employee, I want to set up the warehouse plant by uploading a JSON file.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As Warehouse Employee, I want to set up the warehouse plant by uploading a JSON file.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

From the client clarifications:

* Question: "Regarding the shelves in each row that are part of an aisle, is there a need to differentiate them? If not, how will the AGV know on which shelf to look for a product? Because, as we understood, different products can be placed on a different shelf of the same row, and according to the JSON file provided, each row only states how many shelves it has."
  * [Answer: ](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15758#p20257) "Yes! You need to differentiate the shelves in each row of an aisle."

* Question: "Regarding US2001, should the warehouse employee select from a list the warehouse he wants to set up the plant or should he type, for example, the id of the warehouse he wants to set up the plant?"
  * [Answer: ](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15995#p20587) "Within this prototype, for the sake of simplicity, there is only 1 (one) warehouse."


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* Remark: a pre-defined JSON file can be automatically upload (e.g. at application start-up) to get a default warehouse plant and avoiding the employee to execute this
