### 1.1. User Story Description

As Project Manager, I want that the team to develop and integrate the others components/parts of the AGV digital twin (e.g.: movement, obstacle sensors, control unit).

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

From the client clarifications:

* Question: Dear client,

Question 1:Could you specify how the speed of an AGV is determined, seeing that we do not know the maximum speed of the AGV?

Question 2:At what charge do you suppose the AGV should move to the AGV docker to charge?

Question 3:How should we measure the charging of an AGV should it have a certain percentage per minute or per hour?

Question 4:Could you specify at what percentage the discharging of the AGV happens and if it is affected by other factors other than being turned on?

Question 5:It is mentioned that when the AGV detects an obstacle 2 squares away it should reduce its velocity, could you please quantify the reduction.
* [Answer: ](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=16959#p21734) "Q1: If you need such information, you should collect such information previously (e.g.: US 2002).

Q2: Again, such value might be configurable by AGV (model).

Q3: You should adopt "seconds" as time unit.

Q4: As stated on the specifications' document: "when the AGV is moving battery consumption might be computed based on the travelled distance, but when the AGV is waiting/stopped on its dock battery consumption might be computed based on time.". Other factors might be considered, but at this stage, I recommend you to not apply a complex algorithm.

Q5: It is up to you decide that. However, notice that the idea is to avoid collision.

Yet, about this subject here are some additional hints:
- Choose a speed that allows to see the movement of the AGV on the screen;
- You should define your charging and discharging model. A simplified linear model is perfectly adequate for the problem.
- Define your charging and discharging parameters according to your model.

## 4. Observations

This User Story was a bit harder and took a lot more focus than some others as the team had
never done a task similar to this one.
Even though it took more time and had its difficulties, we were able to complete it.
